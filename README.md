The first, ‘bank_transaction_features.csv’, represents
bank transactions and contains a unique transaction identifier, the transaction description, the
transaction amount and the transaction type. The second, ‘bank_transaction_labels.csv’,
contains the transaction identifier, accounting category and a flag indicating whether the
transaction should be used for training or validation.

Building a model that can classify bank transactions into accounting categories by using the
transaction descriptions. 

● Train the model and any preprocessing steps on the training transactions.

● Evaluating the performance of the model on the validation transactions provided.

● Are there any patterns in transactions that are misclassified by the model?

● Any improvements to the dataset or model?

Implemented appropriate metrics to present findings of the model performance.
